# data-structure-L1
The aim is to apply the basic concepts of data structure, the types(queue, stack, hash tables) and the different operations (save, read, search, sort).


In each directory (food data, road traffic data) there is a .txt file that is being used by each of the program.
Before executing any of them, copy the .txt file and paste it in the same directory as the program file.
